## Intro
This repo contains my standard configurations for unix systems. The intention is that this repo can be easily cloned and deployed to configure new machines and users.

## Bash
In progress.

## Tmux
In progress

## Vim
The best of editors.

### Plugins
#### NERDTree
Very useful for viewing the file tree from right within vim. Mapped to `<C-m>` for toggle. Also note that splits can be navigated with `<C-h/j/k/l>`.

#### NeoComplete
Autocompletion engine that is very featureful. Currently configured with tab completion.

#### CScope
Ensure that cscope is downloaded. Then, once a cscope database has been built for a project, vim can easily search the entire project with the `:cs` command.
