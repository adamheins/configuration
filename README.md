## Intro
This repo contains my standard configurations for unix systems. The intention is that this repo can be easily cloned and deployed to configure new machines and users. Use the `configurator` script to interact with the repo.

## Bash
In progress.

## Tmux
In progress.

## Vim
The best of editors.

### Plugins
#### NeoComplete
Autocompletion engine that is very featureful. Currently configured with tab completion.

#### CScope
Ensure that cscope is downloaded. Then, once a cscope database has been built for a project, vim can easily search the entire project with the `:cs` command.

#### ctrl-p
File search plugin. Press `<C-p>` to search.

#### vim-better-whitespace
Highlights trailing whitespace. Use `:StripWhitespace` to remove trailing whitespace.

#### vim-numbertoggle
Toggle line numbers between absolute and relative mode with `<C-n>`.
