# ~/.\*
This repo contains my standard configurations for POSIX systems. The intention
is that this repo can be easily cloned and deployed to configure new machines
and users. The dotfiles themselves are located in the `files` directory.

## Branches
There are a number of branches in the repo. They are:
* __bash__: Contains deprecated bash dotfiles.
* __osx__: Dotfiles for configuring OSX machines.
* __linux__: Dotfiles for configuring GNU/Linux machines.

## Dotfiler Script
The `dotfiler` script can be run to create symlinks to the dotfiles in this
repo.
